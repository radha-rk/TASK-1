# 🧩Task 1 - Basics of Web Development 

This project is a beginner-level web development task completed during my internship at **ApexPlanet Software Pvt. Ltd.**. It demonstrates my understanding of fundamental **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** concepts by creating a basic, responsive web page layout.

---

## 🚀 Objective

To learn and apply the foundational concepts of web development by:

- Structuring a web page using **HTML**
- Styling the layout using **CSS**
- Adding basic interactivity using **JavaScript**

---

## 🧱 Features

- Responsive card layout covering the full screen width
- Clean and modern UI with a dark theme
- Interactive "Notify Me" button that triggers a JavaScript alert
- Organized content using `div` sections (`text-section`, `image-section`, `card`)
- Includes a 3D-style illustrated image representing the developer

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

- The layout is structured using **HTML div containers**.
- CSS is used to style the card, text, and image to achieve a centered horizontal layout.
- The `Notify Me` button is interactive using a simple `JavaScript alert()`.

---

## 📌 Skills Practiced

- HTML Tags: `div`, `h1`, `p`, `button`, `img`
- CSS Properties: `flexbox`, `padding`, `background-color`, `box-shadow`, `hover`, `transition`
- JavaScript: `alert()` function on button click

## ✅ How to Run
